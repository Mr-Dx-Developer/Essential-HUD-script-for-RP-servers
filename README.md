# Mr_Dx v2
Mr_Dx v2 is your essential script for RP servers. It includes things like RP-Revive, priority cooldown, peacetime  
and a fully customisable hud. You can also make announcements to all players on the server.  

Please make sure to download from the "Releases" section on the right-hand side of this repository.  

Support is available in my discord, linked at the bottom of this page.

And uh, well the stuff on the hud, and the commands.
